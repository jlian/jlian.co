- HomeKit is ok
- Devices are most of time ok 
- Your problems are almost certainly with your Wifi and router, more than anything
- Biggest mistake that people make: not using 5Ghz
- Bonjour services can sometimes get out of wack across bands
- Since most IoT devices are 2.4Ghz
- Use this app to check if you phone can discover them on Bonjour
- If not, your router is doing something funky
- I solved it by following this blog to disable advanced features for my router
- Always solid now
