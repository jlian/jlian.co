The previous owner ran CAT6, HDMI, and speaker lines through the walls, so this closet could become the single entry point for everything. All the distribution for the rooms happens here, which also means I can work on the mess without crawling behind the TV.

Here’s the close-up of the panel: cable modem, eero gateway, gigabit switches, and the patch panel for every run in the house. I’m not thrilled the eero has to live here as the router, so I’m still evaluating better router/AP options.

The left wall holds a tiny IKEA pegboard plus a shoe organizer for stray cables, chargers, and wall-warts. Having the spares in arm’s reach cut the time to tidy things up.

Behind the living-room TV, the Hue Sync setup and HDMI 2.1 cabling get their own recessed box. If you want the gory details of the HDMI backlight chain, they’re in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jlian/bb54106116f7160c010e1b55113157cd).

With the TV mounted you can’t see a single cable—the wires dive straight into the wall, head down to the closet, and stay hidden.

Bonus shot: this is what the closet looked like before a marathon labeling, Velcro-ing, and vacuuming session. Totally worth the cleanup.
