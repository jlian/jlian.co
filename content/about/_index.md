I am originally from [Xiamen, China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiamen). I moved to Vancouver in 2004 and went to Shawnigan Lake School on Vancouver Island. 

In 2010, I moved to Montreal to for McGill University, where I studied Mechanical Engineering. As a student, that's where I developed strong interest in tech, robotics, and product/program management.

I now live in Seattle and work at Microsoft Azure.
