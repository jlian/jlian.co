I am originally from [Xiamen, China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiamen). I moved to Vancouver in 2004 and went to Shawnigan Lake School on Vancouver Island.

In 2010, I moved to Montreal for McGill University to study Mechanical Engineering, where I:

- Interned at [Bombardier](http://commercialaircraft.bombardier.com/en/cseries.html) and [Suncor](http://www.suncor.com)
- Played in the [McGill Fight Band](http://www.fightband.com)
- Co-founded [FRC Team 4955 LA Tech](http://www.frc4955.com) and served as lead mentor
- Did research with [Prof. Andrew Higgins](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/facultystaff/staff/andrewhiggins)

I now live in Seattle and am a PM at [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/). Also, I've been volunteering at [FRC Team 1983 Skunkworks Robotics](https://skunkworks.wildapricot.org) as a mechanical design mentor.
