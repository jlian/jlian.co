I'm a PM at [Microsoft Azure IoT](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/iot/), mostly working on [IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub).

Before Microsoft, I studied Mechanical Engineering at McGill University, where I:

- Interned at [Bombardier](http://commercialaircraft.bombardier.com/en/cseries.html) and [Suncor](http://www.suncor.com)
- Played in the [McGill Fight Band](https://mcgillathletics.ca/sports/2012/12/6/1206121625.aspx)
- Co-founded [FRC Team 4955 LA Tech](http://www.frc4955.com) and served as lead mentor
- Did research with [Prof. Andrew Higgins](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/facultystaff/staff/andrewhiggins)

Prior to that, our family moved to Vancouver in 2004, but we're originally from [Xiamen, China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiamen).
